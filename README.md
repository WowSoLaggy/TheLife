# TheLife

This is the console version of "The Game of Life", also known simply as "Life" -
it is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Description

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by it's initial state, requiring no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves,
or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.
